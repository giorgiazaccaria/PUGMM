# PUGMM
Parsimonious Ultrametric Gaussian Mixture Models via grouped coordinate ascent (equivalent to EM) algorithm characterized by the inspection of hierarchical relationships among variables via parsimonious extended ultrametric covariance structures. Extensions for Parsimonious Ultrametric Manly Mixture Models are included.
